/**
 * <p>
 * A {@link ThumbnailMaker} which scales an image by a specified scaling factor
 * when producing a thumbnail.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Upon calculating the size of the thumbnail, if any of the dimensions are
 * {@code 0}, then that dimension will be promoted to {@code 1}. This will
 * cause some resizing operations to not preserve the aspect ratio of the
 * original image.
 * </p>
 * <DL>
 * <DT><B>Usage:</B></DT>
 * <DD>
 * The following example demonstrates how to create a thumbnail which is 25%
 * the size of the source image:
 * <pre>
BufferedImage img = ImageIO.read(new File("sourceImage.jpg"));
BufferedImage thumbnail = new ScaledThumbnailMaker()
        .scale(0.25)
        .make(img);
 * </pre>
 * </DD>
 * </DL>
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to independently specify the scaling factor for the
 * width and height. (If the two scaling factors are not equal then the aspect
 * ratio of the original image will not be preserved.)
 * </p>
 * <DL>
 * <DT><B>Usage:</B></DT>
 * <DD>
 * The following example demonstrates how to create a thumbnail which is scaled
 * 50% in the width and 75% in the height:
 * <pre>
BufferedImage img = ImageIO.read(new File("sourceImage.jpg"));
BufferedImage thumbnail = new ScaledThumbnailMaker()
        .scale(0.50, 0.75)
        .make(img);
 * </pre>
